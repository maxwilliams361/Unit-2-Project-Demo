                <h2>Solution 1:Rapid Rehousing</h2>

                 <h2>Solution 2:Create More Permanent Housing</h2>
           <p>Homelessness in the United States is partly caused by the <a href="https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/how-to-end-homelessness">housing crisis</a>.

                 <h2>Solution 3:Invest in Communities</h2>
              <p> While creating more housing is important, more money and resources need to be spent on providing quality education, health care, and job training opportunities in communities where homeleness is high. These resources could provide <a href="https://www.usich.gov/solutions/jobs/">sustainable career pathways</a> that could help people on a long term.</p>
